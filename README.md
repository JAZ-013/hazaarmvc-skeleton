# Hazaar MVC Skeleton Application

To make it easy to get up and running quickly, we have provided the Hazaar MVC Example Application to serve as a starting point for your development.

## Installing with Composer

The best way to create a new Hazaar MVC project is to use Composer. If you don't have it already installed, then please see [their documentation](http://getcomposer.org) for installation instructions.

To create your new Hazaar MVC project:

```
$ composer create-project hazaarlabs/example path/to/install
```

Once installed, you can test it out immediately using PHP's built-in web server:

```
$ composer serve
```

This will start the PHP cli-server on port 8080, and bind it to all network interfaces.

Note: The built-in CLI server is for development only.
